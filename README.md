## Context
Graphs
Optimizations ?
Contraintes utilisateurs (changement initéraires, multi-moyen-locomotion)
Openstreetmap (comment fetch / quoi fetch ?)
OSMnX / NetworkX

## Goal
We will build a GPS
Multiple cities and at multiple transportation modes (car, walking...)
Using a graph to represent a city (Node are point of interest, edges are roads)
Users can add "warnings" (road blocked, traffic jam...) that change the path or time to arrive at destination
User friendly interface

**<u>Problem solved by the project:</u>**
How to travel the fastest from A to B in a city ?
